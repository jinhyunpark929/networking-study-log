# 🕸️ Networking Fundamentals

This repository contains structured notes and hands-on exercises from my networking studies, focused on real-world IT service operations and cloud infrastructure. The content is primarily based on the Korean book **"Do it! IT 서비스를 위한 네트워크 기초"** (*"Do it! Networking Basics for IT Services"*) and includes additional insights from lectures, study groups, and self-driven exploration.

## 📅 Study Timeline

- **Networking Study Group**: Jan 21, 2025 – Feb 28, 2025  
- **Formal Course Participation**: Feb 18, 2025 – Mar 11, 2025  

I combined independent learning and structured instruction to reinforce both conceptual understanding and applied skills.

## 📘 Main Material

- **Book**: _Do it! IT 서비스를 위한 네트워크 기초_  

## 🧪 Practical Labs & Exercises

While the foundation is theory-focused, I am also integrating basic networking experiments, such as:

- Packet tracing using `Wireshark` and `tcpdump`  
- Simulating DNS, NAT, and port forwarding using local VM environments  
- Testing client-server communication with tools like `curl`, `netcat`, and `traceroute`  
- Exploring Kubernetes networking fundamentals (Services, DNS, Ingress)  
- Configuring simple firewall and routing rules on Linux

> Hands-on examples will be added as markdown guides and shell scripts under the `labs/` directory.
